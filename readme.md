Replication of the Vision Transformer model from the paper "An Image is Worth 16x16 Words: Transformers for Image Recognition at Scale" (https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11929)

Model blocks are implemented in [vit.py](vit.py). Model evaluation is in [replication.ipynb](replication.ipynb)

Fine-tuning is performed with CIFAR-10 images in [fine_tuning.ipynb](fine_tuning.ipynb)
